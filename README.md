# Digimon V-Pet for ESP32/Arduino
This is a fork af the early version of a Digimon VPet for the ESP32 and other Arduino compatible devices made by [Berational91](https://github.com/Berational91)
At the moment there are just [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI/) compatible Displays supported. But you can make your own Display working by just implementing an realization of the abstract DisplayAdapter Class with just 8 Methods.
The Goal of this project is to implement a Digimon VPet with all the functionality of real VPets and compatibility to real Digimon VPets.

At the moment there is just the UI implemented but little functionality. But the Long Term goals are:

Hardware independence:
- the hardware should be highly customizable, so you can use different displays, different inputs etc. 

Berational91 future wanted functionality:
- Internet connectivity through WiFi
- [A-/D-Com](https://www.alphahub.site/guide) functionality 
- it should have a function to act as a gate, to allow 2 people to fight/jogress/... with their original VPETs through the internet
- it should be compatible to real VPETs (so you can fight/jogress/... ESP-VPET vs Original-VPET)
- ability to connect via bluetooth to other ESP32 Vpets to fight/jogress/...

Customizable: 
- it should be easy to add new digimon/pets/evolution lines
- it should be easy to change game mechanics and the UI

# How to install 
## on ESP32 (TTGO T-Display)
Clone the Repo into VSCode/PlatformIO and just flash it to your device. Don't forget to configure your TFT_eSPI library properly (uncommenting/commenting the right line in user_setup_select.h). If you want to use Arduino IDE: the content of main.cpp is equal to arduinos *.ino files. 

## on other Devices:
Clone the Repo and configure TFT_eSPI library properly (uncommenting/commenting the right line in user_setup_select.h). Then change the define macros for the buttons according to your wiring.
